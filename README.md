The first clip in the demo reel is of an umbrella I modeled with a focus on rigging the umbrella to have an easy open and close mechanism. I also focused on the cloth of the top of an umbrella, to make sure it reacted in realisitc ways and moved appropriately with the opening and closing of the umbrella. I also textured and lit the scene to create the effect of a plastic handle and a polyester cloth. 


The second clip is an example of my use of dynamics in maya to create smoke effects in the opening shot and to use cloth effects on the dress and poncho. This is all brought together with animation that is meant to highlight these dynamics through movement.


The third clip is an example of a simple animation meant to mimick a baseball pitch, a run, and a catching of a ball. 


The fourth clip is an example of realistic moddeling of an object.
